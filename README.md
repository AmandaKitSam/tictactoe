- Create the basics from HTML

- Style the page in CSS

- Think about how to use JS to work with my HTML:

  * Be able to switch turns between player one and player two

  * Map out the winning combinations of the game

  * Keep track for the number of turns
    - x wins, y wins or it's tie
    - It appears the title of 'x/y wins' if someone wins; and the message changes every time when someone wins

  * To check whether a win/match has taken place
    - Visually display which side won

- A button for players to re-start the game whenever they wants to

- Use jQuery/CSS to make animations when the user flips the boxes - using a click function

- Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter: adds the scores to each players
