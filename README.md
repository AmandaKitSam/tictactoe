# Tic Tac Toe

## By Amanda Sam

A simple tic tac toe implementation in JavaScript for Project 0 in WDI 23.

- Create the basics in HTML

- Style the page in CSS

- The website is Responsive Web Design

- Important things in the JavaScript file:

1.) Be able to switch turns between player one and player two

2.) Map out the winning combinations of the game

3.) Keep track for the number of turns

4.) The result of the game: x wins, y wins or it's tie
- It appears the title of 'x/y wins' if someone wins; and the message changes every time when someone wins

5.) To check whether a win/match has taken place
- Visually display which side won

6.) A button for players to re-start the game whenever they wants to

7.) Keep track of multiple game rounds with a win counter: adds the scores to each players

-----

Additional feature:
- Use jQuery/CSS to make animations when the user flips the boxes - using a click function
